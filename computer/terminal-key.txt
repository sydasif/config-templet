Tip:- Editing tab title appearance

Windows Terminal supports editing both the color of a tab and its title text, in order to
differentiate one tab from all the others. This can be useful, for example, when connecting
remotely to a critical system.

Let's use both these features together and make a tab entitled "Production" and colored
bright red. Right-click on a tab and select Colorâ€¦ to open a color picker. After selecting
the red color, click the Rename Tab option to open an editor inside the tab bar. Set the
name to "Production" and press Enter. We'll end up with something like Figure 2.4.
The tab color is temporary; if we close the tab, the changes aren't remembered.
