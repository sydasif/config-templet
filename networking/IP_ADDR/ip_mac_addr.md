# Networking

IP Address is work at network layer (layer-3)

## IPv4

IPv4 is 32-Bit Binary Address (written in dotted decimal notation)

Divided into 4 octet

Each octet has 8-Bit

### Private IPv4 Addressing

Class A 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255.255

Class B 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

Class C 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

## IPv6

IPv6: 128-Bit Hex Decimal

2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Divided into 8 Group

Each Group has 16 bit

1. First 32 bit (/32) depict ISP's address range
2. The next 16 bit (32+16=/48) depict unique site's address range
3. The next 16 bit (48+16=/64) depict subnet within the site's address range
4. The remaining 64 bit are used for host IP Address range

## MAC Address

Mac Address work at data link layer (layer-2)

### MAC Addressing

MAC Addr is 48-Bit Hex decimal address divided into two section:-

1. First 24-Bit is assigned by IEEE Organization Unique Identifier (OUI)
2. The next 24-Bit assigned by Vendor
